#### Forever Grateful
Our missions are based on the [F3 Mission Framework](https://github.com/ferstaberinde/F3) by [@ferstaberinde](https://github.com/ferstaberinde). Without Fer and
his team, none of this would be possible

We owe immeasurable thanks to [@arctor](https://github.com/arctor) for spending a ludicrous
amount of time developing an initial framework and teaching us the black
magic ways of SQF along the way.

We also heavily utilize [DAC](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?176926-DAC-V3-1-(Dynamic-AI-Creator)-released&p=2677923&viewfull=1#post2677923) from Silola to manage our AI
spawning and logic. Without this amazing tool, our missions would be very plain indeed.
